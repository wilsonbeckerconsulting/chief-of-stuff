Retroactive capture of Dec 16 standup notes from email thread.

## Brett's Update (Dec 16, 1:42 PM)

P0 field completeness review COMPLETE. Cherre data passes expectations.

### Freshness - All Good

- Building sq ft: 99.88%
- Year built: 94.34%

**cherre_avms (527,361 valuations):**
- Property Links (tax_assessor_id): 100%
- Estimated Value: 100%

  - 15.03% missing (107K transactions)
  - Avg: $3,547,180 | Median: $607,500

### Data Issues for Cherre
- cherre_ingest_datetime = TEXT (should be TIMESTAMP)
- data_publish_date = TEXT (should be DATE)
- ya_loan_maturity_date = TEXT (should be DATE)

### Unused Cherre Tables
- Building permits
- School data
- USA Points of Interest (POI) - most viable for location ratings

### Next Steps
- Transaction-mapping needs to be revisited
- Find top 500-1000 owners, attribute holdings over time
- Sync with Wilson on connecting entity/address data at scale to historical transactions

## Keegan's Update (Dec 16, 7:30 PM)

Working on location rating using POI data.

### POI Extraction
- Source: usa_points_of_interest table
- Batch limited to 100 (usually 1k)
- 8682 zips total, was on zip 331/8682
- Output: cherre_points_of_interest table
- Fields: lat/lon, business_name, address, category, line_of_business, industry, SIC code, phone

### Location Scoring System

**Walk Score (0-100):**
- Based on POI within 1 mile
- Categories: grocery, restaurants, cafes, pharmacies, banks, gyms, parks
- Weights: Grocery highest, then pharmacies/restaurants, then banks/gyms
- Distance decay: 0.25mi = 100%, 0.5mi = 75%, 1mi = 50%
- Diminishing returns on multiples

**Transit Score (0-100):**
- Census commuter data for property's census tract
- % of residents using public transit
- 20%+ = 90-100, 10-20% = 70-89, 5-10% = 50-69, 2-5% = 25-49, <2% = 0-24

**Bike Score (0-100):**
- Census commuter data
- 7%+ = 90-100, 4-7% = 70-89, 2-4% = 50-69, 1-2% = 25-49, <1% = 0-24

**Final Rating:**
- Weighted: 50% walk / 35% transit / 15% bike
- A = 75+, B = 50-74, C = 25-49, D = <25

**Database columns (properties table & properties_api view):**
- walk_score (number)
- transit_score (number)
- bike_score (number)
- loc_rating (A/B/C/D)
- location_score_details (JSON with POI breakdown)
