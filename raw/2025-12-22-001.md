## Standup Notes - Dec 22

### Brett's Breakthrough
- Fixed discrepancy between recorder_ids and tax_assessor_ids → they're not null anymore
- **It was a SQL issue** (now fixed)
- Confirmed 1:1 relationship between recorder_id and tax_assessor_id (at least in small subset tested)
- Still testing to determine how complete the relationships are

### Today's Priority
- Wilson + Brett need to work together TODAY on:
  - How to model the data
  - Enforce referential integrity

### Cherre Call
- Still need to schedule date with Cherre
- **Not blocking** - Wilson can get into Cherre independently

### Migration Visibility
- Wilson working with Keegan on getting visibility into migration from old app → new app

### NMHC File
- Stash has provided the NMHC file
- **Up to Wilson + Brett to clean it up** (not Stash)
