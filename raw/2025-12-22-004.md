## STANDUP 12/22 TLDR

**Brett's Breakthrough:**
• Fixed SQL issue - recorder_ids and tax_assessor_ids are no longer null
• Confirmed 1:1 relationship between recorder_id and tax_assessor_id (testing completeness)
• NMHC membership file received from Stash

**P0 Today:**
• Wilson + Brett data modeling session: design entity resolution model with SCD Type 2 historicals
• Need to map all identifiers (tax_assessor_id, owner_id, cherre_owner_pk, grantor/grantee, etc.) and understand their relationships across Cherre, Yardi, NMHC

**Next Steps:**
• Wilson: Create conceptual data model for entity resolution (properties, entities, transactions)
• Wilson: Investigate Cherre recorder_v2 - verify if additional grantor/grantee data available beyond what Keegan already joined
• Brett: Test cardinality relationships between fields in Yardi and Cherre transactions (verify 1:1 assumptions)
• Wilson: Keegan call later today on migration visibility (old nedl.com → new nedl-ai app)

**Entity Resolution Challenge:**
Large entities operate through 1000+ LLCs with shared/different mailing addresses - need canonical entity mapping with full historicals (SCD Type 2)

**Other:**
• Cherre call still needs scheduling (not blocking - can access independently)
• Leadership (Joe/Stash/Maher) needs visibility on migration timelines, effort, expenses, blockers
