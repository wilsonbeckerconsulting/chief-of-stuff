## Call with Maher - 2pm Dec 19

### New Application Migration
- Eng team moving forward with new application (nedl-ai, the repo we cloned)
- Original app = whatever powers nedl.com currently
- Team wants to map data forward to the new application
- Wilson needs to connect with Keegan to figure out the mapping

### What Maher Needs
- Status update: plan to connect new app with data
- Project plan, blockers, timelines, risks
- Framing: "If we want to get something out in 30 days (or 60 days from X date), how do we migrate existing + new data?"
- Unmasking / ownership mapping is PART of this data migration — not the whole thing

### Visibility Problem
- Maher has ZERO visibility into how original data gets to original app
- Is there an API? Is it cached? Unknown.
- We can be honest with them about current app status

### Investor Reporting Chain
- Maher needs to report to Thiag (investor)
- Joe owns getting the plan into Thiag's hands
- Wilson works with Joe to get info in the format he needs
- Maher closer to tech, Joe handles investor comms

### Deliverable
Maher needs: "Here's what's in the original app, here's the new app, here's the plan to migrate, how do we achieve MVP, iterate new features"

## Comp Proposal (DUE THIS WEEK)

**Working without arrangement currently** ⚠️

### Brett Summers
- Rate: $100/hr
- Availability: 20-30 hrs/week
- Equity: Open to 50% equity / 50% cash (or 60/40 for higher total comp)

### Wilson
- Rate: Thinking $175/hr no equity (if NexTitle commits → has leverage)
- Fallback: $150/hr if NexTitle falls through
- Wife's recommendation: $200/hr
- Availability: 5-15 hrs/week (depends on NexTitle and Shopify)
- Equity: Prefers cash, no equity

### Notes
- Comp proposal due to Maher: **week of 12/29** (soft deadline)
- Should get this formalized before doing more work
- **Stalling NËDL until NexTitle confirms** — call with Brett (NexTitle) at 3:30pm Dec 19
