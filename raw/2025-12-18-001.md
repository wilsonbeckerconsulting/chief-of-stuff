Call with Brett Summers (fellow contractor) at 7pm ET Thursday Dec 18.

## Timeline
- Dec 12 (Fri): Dry run standup (Day -1). Went well. Billed 45 min.
- Dec 15 (Mon): Day 1. Brett's P0 was field completeness.
- Dec 15-17: User OOO, no hours billed. Brett running standups.
- Dec 18 (Thu): Back online. Brett sync call ~10 min.

## Field Completeness Findings
- Most fields are 95%+ complete
- Transaction file is incomplete - cause unknown
- Brett has been working this since Day 1

## Cherre Data Provider
Cherre (C-H-E-R-R-E) is an aggregated data provider. They source data from various places, aggregate it, sell subscriptions.

Key questions:
1. Does Cherre provide enough data for NËDL to be competitive?
2. Are they extracting all the fields from Cherre that they're paying for?

Brett started doing initial passes on Cherre data. Not super complete.

Brett proposed looking at alternative data sources (his specialty - finding alt data sources, working out contracts). BUT: they don't want alt data sources right now.

## TOP PRIORITY: Ownership Map
For a given property, who actually owns it? Name on record → company → parent company → actual owner.

**Critical: They want historicals (SCD Type 2).** Need to track ownership changes over time.

## NMHC Data Source
Brett found NMHC - top 50 largest institutional holders of commercial real estate. Good starting point since these entities likely own many properties in the database.

Brett doesn't know what to do with the data. Need to help him figure it out Friday or next week (Christmas week - tight timeline).

## System Access
Keegan (CPO) granted access to all systems after Dec 12 dry run. User has 18 unread emails with access credentials, API keys, links. Need to capture these in a local secrets file.
