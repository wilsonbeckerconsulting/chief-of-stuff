## Questions for Keegan Call (Migration Planning)

### Database Architecture
1. Same database for old nedl.com and new nedl-ai app, or separate?
2. Where does Cherre data live in relation to old/new apps?
3. How does data currently get to the original app? (Maher has zero visibility - is there an API? cached? what's the flow?)

### Migration Scope
1. What's being migrated? (User data? Transactions? Historical analytics? Features?)
2. What's being rebuilt from scratch?
3. Is the ownership map a net-new feature or replacing something in the old system?

### Data Model Mapping
1. What fields/entities from old system map to new system?
2. What's deprecated in the new system?
3. What needs transformation during migration?

### Timeline & MVP
1. What's the MVP definition for the new app?
2. Realistic timeline for migration? (Maher framing: 30 days? 60 days?)
3. What are the critical path dependencies?

### Role Clarity
1. Am I owning data quality + migration planning, or just ensuring data quality for someone else's migration plan?
2. Who owns the overall migration project plan?
3. What does Keegan need from me vs. what can he provide?

### Deliverable for Leadership
Maher needs: "Here's what's in the original app, here's the new app, here's the plan to migrate, how do we achieve MVP, iterate new features"
- What documentation/architecture diagrams exist?
- What's missing that I need to create?

## Context
- Ownership mapping is PART of data migration, not the whole thing
- Maher reporting to Thiag (investor) through Joe
- Need project plan with blockers, timelines, risks
- Currently working WITHOUT comp arrangement (proposal due week of 12/29)
