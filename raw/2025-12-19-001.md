## Standup Notes - Dec 19

### Brett's Progress
- Started exploration on NMHC top 50
- Building a linking table in Supabase
- Built `canonical_owner_rollup` and other `canonical_owner_*` tables
- In canonical_owner_rollup: entity map showing how many entities at each address
- Out of top 100 addresses → ~14k entities operating out of those addresses
- Goal: xref entities and addresses to Cherre's unmask file

### Stash's Contribution
- Has full NMHC membership directory extracted (names, phone, emails, LinkedIn)
- Includes big companies like AT&T
- File needs cleanup, will send it
- Doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m0r_C1EHsulYlSDg8xNK05OEyJTL2KVJKGVjQmQ7DtE/edit?gid=0#gid=0

### Cherre Unmask File
- Has `last_seen_date` (recent transactions) and `cherre_owner_pk`
- Could link to other tables on `tax_assessor_id` and `owner_id`
- Problem: lots of nulls for tax_assessor_id in mapping table → hard to join

### Missing Data Issue
- Don't have full recorder file
- In Cherre data dict, `recorder_v2` table has:
  - `recorder_id` = exact transaction happening on a date
  - `tax_assessor_id` = unique ID for the property
- If you combine those two → full map of who's doing what
- Need to check if those data points are in Cherre via GraphQL

### Action Items (Wilson)
- [ ] Coordinate w/ Keegan; send Adam Fung availability for Tuesday
- [ ] Delete "Nedl Data Transformation" WhatsApp community → use "needle data" group chat instead
- [ ] Post standup TLDR to group chat, set group photo
- [ ] Text Brett to schedule offline entity-resolution planning session
- [ ] Check with Cherre via GraphQL if recorder_v2 data is available

### Decisions
- WhatsApp "Nedl Data Transformation" community being deleted (restricted posting, hidden members)
- All communication moving to "needle data" group chat
- Adam Fung (Cherre) intro call targeting Tuesday

### Core Challenge
Entity resolution across multiple sources:
- Cherre unmask file
- NMHC membership directory
- canonical_owner_* tables

Need to figure out how to build the linking table and keep it high quality and up to date. Once we can identify true owner at property level → move on to next phase.
