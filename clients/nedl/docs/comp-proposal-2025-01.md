# NËDL Compensation Proposal - January 2025

**Status:** Draft
**Due:** Week of Jan 3, 2025
**Parties:** Wilson, Brett Summers, NËDL (Joe, Stash, Maher)

---

## Context

- Working without formal comp arrangement since project start
- Rates already aligned: Wilson $150/hr, Brett $100/hr
- NËDL is cash-constrained, open to equity
- Need to formalize before continuing significant work

---

## Scope of Work

| Deliverable | Owner | Status | Notes |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Unified data model | Wilson | ✅ Deployed | ETL pipeline running daily, SCD Type 2 |
| App migration (v1 → v2) | Wilson | Pending | Hook AI to app, create ETLs in required format. Most work = fixing vibe-coded app issues |
| Investor visibility | Wilson | Pending | GTM deck for Joe → Stash/Thiag |
| Exit offshore devs | Wilson | In progress | Automation + documentation so AI can maintain |
| New data sources | Brett | Pending | Scope TBD, Brett's specialty |
| Data validation/benchmarking | Brett | Ongoing | Validate ownership data against his work |

---

## Value Quantification

### 1. Exit Offshore Devs
**Question:** What does NËDL pay the offshore team monthly?

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Your Ask (10-20%) |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Small team | $5,000 | $60,000 | $6,000 - $12,000 |
| Larger team | $10,000 | $120,000 | $12,000 - $24,000 |

**Value prop:** Once pipelines are automated and documented, AI (Claude Code) can fix bugs and add features. No ongoing dev team needed.

### 2. Investor Visibility (GTM Deck)
- Enables Joe's conversations with Stash/Thiag
- Consultant equivalent: $10-15k for polished deck with data backing
- Hard to quantify directly, but high strategic value

### 3. Data Model + Migration
- Foundation for product, predictions, and automation
- Build cost equivalent: Senior data engineer @ $150-200/hr × 200 hrs = $30-40k
- You're delivering efficiently (already mostly done)

### 4. New Data Sources (Brett)
- Value depends on what sources and impact on product
- TBD — need to align with Brett on scope
- Market rate: $100-150/hr for data sourcing consulting

### Total Value Summary

| Deliverable | Value to NËDL | 
|-------------|---------------|
| Exit offshore devs | $60-120k/yr saved |
| Investor deck | $10-15k (consultant equiv) |
| Data model + migration | $30-40k (build cost) |
| New data sources | TBD |
| **Total** | **$100-175k+** |

## Proposal Options

### Option 1: Independent Contractors (Hourly)
- Wilson and Brett invoice separately
- Wilson: $150/hr, Brett: $100/hr
- NËDL manages two vendor relationships

**Pros:** Simple, flexible
**Cons:** Two invoices, less coordination

### Option 2: Team Arrangement (Hourly via Wilson)
- Wilson invoices NËDL for both
- Wilson pays Brett separately, handles 1099
- Tighter coordination, single point of contact

**Pros:** One vendor relationship for NËDL
**Cons:** More admin for Wilson

### Option 3: Flat Fee (Value-Based)
- Fixed price for defined scope: **$40,000**
- ~25-30% of value delivered ($100-150k)
- Wilson and Brett split pro-rata based on hours × rates

**Example split:**
- Wilson: 150 hrs × $150 = $22,500 (60%)
- Brett: 100 hrs × $100 = $10,000 (40%)
- Wilson gets: $24,000 | Brett gets: $16,000

**Pros:** De-risks for NËDL (fixed cost), incentivizes efficiency
**Cons:** Risk on contractors if scope creeps

### Option 4: Hybrid (Lower Cash + Equity)
- Reduced flat fee: **$25,000**
- Plus equity: **X%** (TBD based on valuation)
- Aligns incentives with company success

**Questions for equity:**
- What's the company valued at (or last round)?
- What % are they offering?
- Vesting schedule? Cliff?
- Common stock, options, or other instrument?

---

## Open Questions

1. **Offshore team cost:** What does NËDL pay monthly? (Needed to quantify savings)
2. **Brett's scope:** What data sources? Estimated hours?
3. **Equity details:** If they want to include equity, need valuation and terms
4. **Payment timing:** Monthly? Milestone-based? On completion?

---

## Recommendation

Given NËDL is cash-constrained:
- **Lead with Option 4** (hybrid) — shows flexibility, aligns interests
- **Fallback to Option 3** (flat fee) if equity discussion gets complicated
- Avoid Option 1/2 if they're worried about cash burn

## Draft Email to Founders

**To:** Joe, Stash, Maher
**Subject:** Compensation Arrangement — Proposal for Discussion

Hey team,

Wanted to follow up on formalizing the compensation arrangement for the work Brett and I are doing.

**Quick update on progress:**
- ETL pipeline is deployed and running daily (Cherre → dimensional model)
- Dev and prod environments set up with full automation
- DQ checks, alerting, documentation — all in place
- Goal: get you to a point where you don't need the offshore dev team

**For the engagement, I see a few options:**

1. **Hourly (independent)** — Brett and I invoice separately at our agreed rates ($150/$100)

2. **Hourly (team)** — I invoice for both, single vendor relationship for you

3. **Flat fee** — Fixed price for the full scope (data model, migration, investor visibility, automation). Thinking ~$40k, which is roughly 25-30% of the value we're delivering (offshore savings alone is $60-120k/yr)

4. **Hybrid** — Lower cash + equity stake. Happy to discuss if this fits better given cash constraints.

Before we finalize, a few questions:
- What are you paying the offshore team monthly? (Helps quantify the savings we're creating)
- Any preference on structure?
- If equity is on the table, what does that look like?

Happy to jump on a call this week to discuss. Let me know what works.

Best,
Wilson

## Notes

- Brett asked about equity for flat fee option — consider success bonus as alternative
- Equity conversations can get complicated; don't let it block the engagement
- If they push back on $40k, can negotiate down but anchor high
