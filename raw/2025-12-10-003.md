NËDL has a WhatsApp group - need to figure out if agent can get access to read messages. 

Considering starting a Notion for NËDL. Want this project to have access to read those docs. Need to think through how that integration would work.

Need documentation strategy for both NËDL and NexTitle. They surely don't have anything figured out for docs.

Questions to solve:
- How to get WhatsApp messages into this system?
- How to integrate Notion so agent can read docs?
- What's the doc strategy for both clients?
