## Standup Notes - Dec 22

### Brett's Breakthrough
- Fixed discrepancy between recorder_ids and tax_assessor_ids → they're not null anymore
- **It was a SQL issue** (now fixed)
- Confirmed 1:1 relationship between recorder_id and tax_assessor_id (at least in small subset tested)
- Still testing to determine how complete the relationships are

### Today's Priority
- Wilson + Brett need to work together TODAY on:
  - How to model the data
  - Enforce referential integrity

### Cherre Call
- Still need to schedule date with Cherre
- **Not blocking** - Wilson can get into Cherre independently

### Migration Visibility
- Wilson working with Keegan on getting visibility into migration from old app → new app
- **Old system:** nedl.com (existing user portal - paid logins)
- **New system:** Keegan vibe-coded new app (believe it's needl-ai repo, built with Vercel)
- **Repos cloned:** ~/Desktop/src (not yet explored)
- **Need to understand:** Data model mapping (old → new)
  - What fields/entities from old system map to new system?
  - Same database or separate migration needed?
- **Call with Keegan later today** to get architecture visibility
- **Leadership needs visibility:** Joe, Stash, Maher need timelines, effort, expenses, blockers for entire migration effort

### NMHC File
- Stash has provided the NMHC file
- **Up to Wilson + Brett to clean it up** (not Stash)
